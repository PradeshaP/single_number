 Description
This C++ program defines a solution to the problem of finding the single number in an array of integers where every element appears twice except for one. The program uses a map (hash table) to count the occurrences of each number and then identifies the number that appears only once.

 Features
- Utilizes a hash map to store counts of each integer.
- Efficiently finds and returns the single number.
- Demonstrates basic usage of C++ STL (Standard Template Library) with `vector` and `map`.
